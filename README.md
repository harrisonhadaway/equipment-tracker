# Equipment Tracker

This is my final project for my full stack web developer bootcamp at Awesome Inc U. The goal of this project is to streamline the tracking and managing records on equipment. The industries that could utilize this to track their equipment is pretty broad from agriculture, logging, construction, all the way down to hobby collectors.
